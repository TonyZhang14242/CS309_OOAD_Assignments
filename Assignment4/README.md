## What you can and what you cannot
You can:
- Work on an assignment with a friend, and think together about the program structure, share ideas and even the global logic. At the time of actually writing the code, you should write it alone.
- Use in an assignment a piece of code found on the web, as long as you indicate in a comment where it was found and don't claim it as your own work.
- Help friends debug their programs
- Show your code to friends to explain the logic, as long as the friends write their code on their own later

You cannot:
- Take the code of a friend and make a few cosmetic changes and pass it as your own work

## Warning!
1. Don't try to plagiarize, and we ensure we will launch duplication checking programs for your submission after deadline.
2. Considering the forked repository cannot be private, It does not seem like a good idea that you fork this repository. If you fork this repository, do not push any of your code before the deadline. It is suggested you use this repository as a template and set it to private.
